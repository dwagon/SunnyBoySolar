This code grabs data from a SunnyBoy PhotoVoltaicCell Regulator which you access by plugging the remote bluetooth unit into your computer with USB.

This mounts as /Volume/NO NAME on a Mac, but will be something different on other OS.

Running the importer will pull data from the Sunny Boy and add it to the Django database.

The the graph.py script will generate a bunch of csv files that I found interesting, that you can then import into whichever graphing software you prefer
